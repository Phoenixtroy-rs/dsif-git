Report on Capstone Assignment
In this project, we tested the impact of certain variables on the target variable. In order to do this, we assessed the varaibles on which the loan amount was dependent on, and the also assessed the impact of certain variables on the target variable which was whether there would be a default or not.

Data Preparation and Cleaning
The data was preprocessed, irrelevant columns were dropped, columns with a high amount of missing values were also dropped.

Exploratory Data Analysis
As part of the exploratory data analysis to detect the data characteristics and determine which variables were more correlated, visualisation was performed using both a heatmap, and a histogram. It was found that there was a high correlation between the loan amount and variables such as installment and funded amount.

Modelling
For the modelling, both a baseline and a challenger model were tested. There were found not to perform so differently. In order to improve model performance, it would be helpful to retest the variables and check for more correlation and then use highly correlated variables to build and evaluate other models
